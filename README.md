# Palindrome-Finder

This Palindrome Finder functions in order to identify words known as palindromes, that read the same if read backwards.
This Python program will:
Ask the user to enter a word or phrase
Strip the user’s input of any spaces, capitalization, or unwanted punctuation
Compare the cleaned version of the user’s input to its reverse
If the word or phrase is a palindrome, the user is congratulated
Allow the user to enter multiple attempts
All successful attempts will be saved in a list and returned to the user when exiting the program
